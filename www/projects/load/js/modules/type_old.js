Too much things been done here
what we need is class/type (+ definitions storage or not) system


- Classes
- Types
- Definition

Class has a Type
Type has a definition
Definition is meant to be stored as data in a scope thru a namespace
Namespace represents actual unique location descriptor, 
while Package is a particular location (locatable) object that contains Class Definitions
and Class Definitions are other particular locations 




Ways to solve this that I see :
