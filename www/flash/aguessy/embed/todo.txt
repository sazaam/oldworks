deadline : Samedi 25 Juillet 2009


TODO sam (developpement)
	- finish home page, and add a special help-tutorial layer,
	- develop news section,
	- develop medias section, just a small explanation what is really media, and a redirection link.
	- code & design a smoothe small volume masterer,
	- develop the scroll situations therefore decided.
	


TODO sam (preparation & graphics)
	- drawingz + scanning portfolio-featuring items
	- find arrows for the graphic,
	- design the help layer.
	


	

TODO Koss (decision)
	- graphic issues of the pre-home landing page (leading 2 the flash popup)
	- what to do about the fullscreenable or not problem :
		.has a problem with too low sizes and too high ones,
		.there is also a problem when, in a 'static' text page, the content 
		will have to be 'gridded'(dot background) and scrollable.
		.will have a pb meeting the video container, and the description text.
	- decide what color goes with which section within the hierarchy
	- decide what background goes exactly with what section or subsection of the hierarchy (in most 'static sections')
	
TODO Koss (preparation)
	- give Sam an exemple of late news article, with pictures, so can check the disposition of textual content next to visual, 
	in order to define rules for this section.
	- check all contents (in order of importance)
	- browse quickly the first dynamic inputs :
		projects featuring in Portfolio,
		feeds featuring in News,
		press-clippings featuring in Press.
	- check with sam all considered 'static' textes, and disposition, 
	once the scrolling system is voted by Koss :
		.team
		.portrait
		.awards & exhibitions 
		(special Sam Request : do not regroup two parts with an '&',
		I'll rather use a section 'awards', and one 'exhibitions', the same in 'news & press',
		which I'll prefer as two separate sections, as well, for pure functional development issues (special encoding of the & symbol, etc...))
		.contacts
		.legal
		.credits (I'm hesitating, why not put it in first front page, not home, pre-home, in very dark and small, very simple html credits.)
